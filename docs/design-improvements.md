## Implementation Instructions

To integrate these improvements into the main application:

1. **Update Font Configuration**
   - Add Inter, Poppins, and Manrope fonts to the project
   - Update tailwind.config.js with the new font family definitions

2. **Replace Current Components**
   - Replace `Header.tsx` with `HeaderImproved.tsx` in the layout component
   - Replace `Hero.tsx` with `HeroImproved.tsx` in the home page
   - Replace the current cohort advantage section with `CohortAdvantageCarousel.tsx`
   - Replace `ContactUs.tsx` with `ContactSectionImproved.tsx`

3. **Add Required Dependencies**
   - Ensure lucide-react is installed for icons
   - Add required animation libraries (already using framer-motion)

4. **Update Page Layout**
   - Ensure proper imports in the page layout components
   - Update any references to the replaced components

## Testing Checklist
